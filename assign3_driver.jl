#=**************************************************************************
This is the top level function in an ozone NOx formaldehyde mechanism, rewritten from Fortran
by Obin Sturm (UC Davis) in October 2019.  It has been adapted in order to generate training
data for machine learning and restricted inverse algorithms.
Written in Julia Version 1.2.0, tested up to 1.4.2

For questions please contact Obin Sturm at posturm@ucdavis.edu

Notable changes:
Oct 2019 -- Random seeding of concentrations, looping over days, incorporating
            fluctuating daylight constant (HV) values.
         -- Option to use stiff equation solver.  To use this
            integration method, set method to "stiff!" instead of "euler!"
            Note: deprecated March 2020

Mar 2020 -- Implementation of a NaN in the first column of S output matrix
            when using "euler" method.  This is used as a flag for when
            concentrations are negative and a mass balance violation occurs
            (a limitation of the original Fortran mechanism).
            Note: removed January 2021

July 2021 -- Fix of a printing bug inherited from original Fortran code,
            that printed pseudo-steady state species as zero. This is fixed
            in euler.jl

            Inputs:
             t1   - start time in minutes
             t2   - stop time in minutes
             tm   - concentration recording timestep
             days - number of independent trials from t1 to t2
            Outputs:
             C    -  species concentrations, each column a new species
             S    -  integrated rate of reaction, each column a new reaction
             J    -  daylight constant influencing photolytic reactions

            The purpose of this program is to act as a driver for the evaluation and
            integration of a model ozone mechanism involving NOx and formaldehyde.
            Note: the "active" array contains active species in the first "maxact"
            locations and buildup species in the remaining "maxbo" locations.
