# Julia photochemical model
The Julia photochemical model (formerly FormO3NOx) is small photochemical mechanism with reactions related to ozone formation: NOx chemistry, VOC chemistry, formation of a peroxy radical from VOC chemistry, and further reaction of the peroxy radical with NO to form NO2 and OH. It is based on a Fortran mechanism from Dr. Michael Kleeman's graduate course ECI241 on air quality modeling at University of California, Davis.

# Code Structure and Output
The top level module for the mechanism is contained in the file assign3_driver.jl.  The wrapper program MLAQ.jl runs this module for 365 simulated days, generating concentration data every 6 minutes, saved as the text file C_and_J.txt. The rows of C.txt correspond to the time steps, one column to a daylight constant "J" between zero and one which affects the rate of the photochemical reactions, and the rest of the columns to the species. This mechanism also generates the integrated rate of reaction over every 6 minutes and saves this information as S.txt, rows corresponding to new time-steps and columns corresponding to the reactions.

The output files C_and_J.txt and S.txt are available for download.

Further documentation is contained in the .jl files.
