    The purpose of this subroutine is to use an explicit Euler method to
    integrate a set of coupled ordinary differential equations between t1
    and t2.

    Inputs:
     t1   - start time
     t2   - stop time
     dt   - fixed integration time step
     tm   - concentration recording timestep
     c    - initial active species concentrations
     n    - number of active species
     diff - name of the subroutine to evaluate the derivative dc/dt = diff

    Outputs:
     C    -  species concentrations reported at specific time intervals
